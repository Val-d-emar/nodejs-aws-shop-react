## Task 6: SQS & SNS, Async Microservices Communication

### What was done:
- [x] Created an SQS queue `catalogItemsQueue` in the Product Service stack.
- [x] Implemented the `catalogBatchProcess` lambda function triggered by SQS events (configured with `batchSize: 5`).
- [x] Updated the `importFileParser` lambda in the Import Service to send parsed CSV records directly to the SQS queue instead of logging them.
- [x] Implemented transaction-based product creation (writing to `products` and `stocks` DynamoDB tables simultaneously).
- [x] Created an SNS Topic `createProductTopic` with an Email subscription.
- [x] The `catalogBatchProcess` lambda successfully publishes an event to the SNS topic upon product creation.
- [x] Implemented Cross-Stack references (Exports/Imports) for SQS URL and ARN to maintain dynamic and secure infrastructure.

### Additional scope (Optional tasks):
- [x] **+15** - `catalogBatchProcess` lambda is fully covered by unit tests (using AWS SDK mocks). Test output is kept clean.
- [x] **+15** - Configured a **Filter Policy** for the SNS `createProductTopic`. Email notifications are distributed only if the product price is >= 100 (implemented via `MessageAttributes`).
