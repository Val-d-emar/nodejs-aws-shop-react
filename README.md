## What was done?

- [x] AWS CDK Stack contains configuration for `importProductsFile` function
- [x] The `importProductsFile` lambda function returns a correct response which can be used to upload a file into the S3 bucket
- [x] Frontend application is integrated with `importProductsFile` lambda
- [x] The `importFileParser` lambda function is implemented and AWS CDK. Stack contains configuration for the lambda
- [x] **+10** **(All languages)** - `importProductsFile` lambda is covered by _unit tests_.
- [x] **+10** **(All languages)** - `importFileParser` lambda is covered by _unit tests_.
- [x] **+10** **(All languages)** - At the end of the stream the lambda function should move the file from the `uploaded` folder into the `parsed` folder (`move the file` means that file should be copied into a new folder in the same bucket called `parsed`, and then deleted from `uploaded` folder)
