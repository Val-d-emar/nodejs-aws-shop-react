## Task 7 (Authorization)

### What was done:
- [x] authorization-service is added to the repo, has correct basicAuthorizer lambda and correct AWS CDK Stack
- [x] Import Service AWS CDK Stack has authorizer configuration for the importProductsFile lambda. Request to the importProductsFile lambda should work only with correct authorization_token being decoded and checked by basicAuthorizer lambda. Response should be in 403 HTTP status if access is denied for this user (invalid authorization_token) and in 401 HTTP status if Authorization header is not provided.
- [x] Client application is updated to send "Authorization: Basic authorization_token" header on import. Client should get authorization_token value from browser localStorage

### Additional scope (Optional tasks):
- [x] +30 - Client application should display alerts for the responses in 401 and 403 HTTP statuses. This behavior should be added to the nodejs-aws-fe-main/src/index.tsx file.
